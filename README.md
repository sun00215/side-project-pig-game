# Pig Game

Pig Game is a fun and engaging dice game where players roll dice and accumulate points to reach a winning score. Players must strategize when to hold their score and when to risk another roll. This project features a sleek and intuitive interface for a delightful gaming experience.

## Game Rules

- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their round score.
- But, if the player rolls a 1, all their round score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that their round score gets added to their total score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach 100 points on total score wins the game.
